# Problem
Keeping track of information in an average Nigerian University is hard, there's hardly consistency with information related to fixed classes, assignment due dates, exam dates, this is mostly because there isn't a centralized way of managing and distributing this information across students.
<p>
  Education has also transcended from just a single activity to something more complicated, you now have students engaged in other activities outside school, sometimes it's work, other times it's personal things. It becomes difficult for these set of students to keep track of their shcool life and schedule.

## Introduction
> Nudge is a concept in behavioral science, political theory and behavioral economics which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals.


An Automated class management and time tracking system, to keep track of your school and work time, notify you on changes to your timetable, fixed classes, exam dates, and always make sure you're aware of deadlines. This system is able to automatically monitor your deadlines and text, or call you depending on the state of those deadlines.

  - Having notes synched across devices from any device, so you don't have to worry when you miss a class.
  - For students, you can be notified of classes, assignment due dates, and also get that nudge you need to attend to them with an automated call.
  - For teachers, tracking your class engagement just got easier, Nudge provides realtime analytics via student feedbacks, for you to know how you're doing with class, an opportunity for improvement (üòâ)


# Proposed Stack

Node, Firebase, Twilio API, Flutter, Vue

# Benefit

- To create better student - teacher relationship
- To help keep track of global class statistics, not a lot of data about class activities are recorded, hence no one really knows how an average nigerian class feels like, with gathered student data and engagement statistics, we can have this.
- Help Students Manage their time, they won't have to miss a lecture if they can help it.
- Keeping consistent class data and information across students (timetable changes, events)
- Increase the standard of learning in an average Nigerian School
